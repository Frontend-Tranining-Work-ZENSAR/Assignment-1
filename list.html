        Animals are an important part of the food cycle, and humans depend on them for a wide range of requirements.
        
        It is important to save animals from extinction and human predators who like to hunt them for their personal gains.
        
        Human life has become supreme to all else with no respect left for nature. To keep the balance of nature in place we have to save animals, hence the motto.</p></h4></b>

        <li>Dog :- <p><i><em><small> A dog is a mammal in the order Carnivora. The history of dogs is an old tale indeed. You could say as long as there has been civilisation, there have been records of humans and dogs. Dogs were domesticated from wolves around 15,000 years ago.</em></small></i></p></li>

        <li>Hours :- <p><i><em><small> The modern horse (Equus caballus) evolved on the North American continent. Disappearing from this area around 10,000 years ago (end of the Pleistocene epoch), it survived on the European/Asian continent. Horses were brought back to North America by the Spanish in the 1500s.</em></small></i></p></li>

        <li>Cat :-  <p><i><em><small> For a long time, it was a widely held belief that cats originated in Egypt some 4,000 years ago. However, thereâ€™s now DNA evidence showing that cats and humans have been living together for 12,000 years. Talk about a long cat domestication history.</em></small></i></p></li>
